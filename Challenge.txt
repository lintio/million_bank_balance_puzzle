An imaginary bank is running a competition to win £1,000,000.
You make a deposit on day one and another on day two.
On day three the bank adds the two previous days balances together and that is now your new balance.
They repeat this each day adding your previous two day’s balances together until your balance reaches
or exceeds £1,000,000. If you get to 1,000,000 exactly you win the £1,000,000.

If you go over you lose your initial deposits.
Clearly to get to exactly £1,000,000 in a few days is easy assuming you have a lot of money to make your initial deposits.
So the winner has to reach exactly £1,000,000 in the most number of days. 
Your initial deposits can only be whole pounds, no pence.
So the question is:
What should your initial two deposits be in order to take the 
longest to get to £1,000,000 and win the cash?

day 1
    pay in (ammout)
    d1_balance = ammout
day 2
    pay in (amount)
    d2_balance = d1_balance + amount
day 3
    bank pays in (d1_balance + d2_balance)
    d3_balance = d2_balance + (d1_balance + d2_balance)
day 4
    bank pays in (d2_balance + d3_balance)
    d4_balance = d3_balance + (d2_balance + d3_balance)
